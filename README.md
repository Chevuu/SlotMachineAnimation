## Description

This project is made for only one reason and that was to figure out how to make spinning aniomation using CSS for my much bigger ongoing project. At first i struggled to make this as a complete CSS nooby. And one day, you know that feeling when you just randomly while doing something completely different think of a solution and are like BOOM! Well if you ever need to create a slot machine spinning animation and that's your only goal, here's a very simple repo for you. You even have a demo below.
